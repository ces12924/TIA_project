# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier 🐱🐶
 **In Progress**

## Overview
This project is a **work-in-progress neural network** that classifies images as either **cats or dogs**. It uses a labeled **Kaggle dataset**, preprocesses the images, and trains an image classifier for binary classification.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset  
- Images are resized and normalized before training  
- Dataset is not included in this repository

## Method
- Load and preprocess image data  
- Train a neural network on processed images  
- Evaluate classification performance

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow
- NumPy  

## Planned Improvements
- Data augmentation  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Model evaluation and saving  
- Inference on new images
